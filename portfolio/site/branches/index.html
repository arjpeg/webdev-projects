		<p>According to Merriam Webster, programming is "the process of preparing an instructional program for a device
			(such as a computer)
			", but to me, it is much more about problem solving and create unique solutions to problems. But of course,
			like with any field, there are many branches of programming, which is what this webpage will be about.</p>

	<h2>The Different Branches</h2>
	<div id="branches">

			<h3>Machine Learning</h3>

			<p>Machine Learning is all about training a computer how to transform inputs that it recives into outputs.
				At its core, this is all about matrix multiplication, a lot of linear algebra, and calculus, which is
				why most people don't start from the ground up, but use libraries to make the process eaiser.</p>

			<h3>Web Programming</h3>

			<p>One of the most exciting fields in computer science (in my opinion) is web development, which is all
				about letting people connect with each other. The rise of the internet has been a <b>huge</b> change in
				we communicate with each other. The underlying architecture typically looks like the image above, where
				there are clients all connected to a server, exchanging data back and forth.</p>

			<h3>App Development</h3>

					alt="image of the app store" class="branch-image">
			</div>
			<p>Through the rise of smartphones, one of the most prolific ways people have stayed connected in this
				digital world are applications (or apps for short). Some of the most popular apps include, Twitter,
				Snapchat, and Ticktock. While it is great that people can stay so connected, it is also worrying on how
				addicting they are.</p>
